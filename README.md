This program is written in JavaScript using the p5.js. I have created a canvas on which a black ellipse is drawn at coordinates (x, y). The ellipse moves diagonally because of the variable "speed" in addition to both x and y in each animation frame. Once it reaches the canvas boundaries, x > 500 or x < 0, the speed is inverted to make it bounce back.

The colour of the background can change by making the values of the variables a, b, and c. These variables can be changed by using mouse and keyboard inputs. When the left mouse button is clicked, the background colour changes to green. Also by clicking the right mouse button, it changes it to blue and the center button changes it to yellow. To control the speed of the moving ellipse, you can use the arrow keys. The up-arrow key increases the speed, while the down-arrow key decreases it.
